# Lessons Learned
This project was challenging. I got a better understanding of inheritance and how all these classes communicate amongst each other and access each others information. I utilized loops to account for certain conditions which made my code work properly. I utilized methods to keep my launch() method clean. Overall this project was a great opportunity to put the knowledge we've learned the past four weeks to the test.
